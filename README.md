You will need a couple of things before running this file. First, you will need to install chromedriver 
which version cooresponds to the version of chrome on your pc. For example, my chrome version is 92.0.4515.159.
You can chech your version by typing chrome://version in the search bar. Get the driver from this link here
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. Next you will need to install selenium for python. Do it using
this terminal command here: pip install selenium. Oh, one last impoirtand thing: Make sure chromedriver is 
added to path if you are working on a Windows pc. If you are working on a Mac, chromedriver isn't a trusted
developer so look here for what to do with that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60362018/macos-catalinav-10-15-3-error-chromedriver-cannot-be-opened-because-the-de.

As always, enjoy this project and try not to get banned ðŸ™‚
