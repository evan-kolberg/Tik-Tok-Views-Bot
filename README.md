## TikTok Views Bot
### This program, unfortunately, no longer works. It was never designed to work forever and rather served as a proof of concept.
[Here](https://www.tiktok.com/@how_am_i_not_banned) can be found a digital shrine that captures the beauty between the rise of young developers (like myself) crossing paths with the restructuring of a popular social media platform (Tik Tok).

Years ago, this was the ReadME that other GitHub users followed to join in on the fun:

You will need a couple of things before running this file.

1. First, you will need to install the version of Chromedriver 
that corresponds to the version of Chrome on your computer. For example, my Chrome version is 92.0.4515.159.
You can check your version by typing chrome://version in the search bar. Get the driver from this link [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 

2. Next, you will need to install the Selenium library for Python. Do it using
this terminal command: pip install selenium. 

Oh, one last thing: Make sure Chromedriver is added to the path environmental variable if you are working on a Windows pc. If you are working 
on a Mac, Chromedriver will need additional permissions to run as it is not a trusted developer. Look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60362018/macos-catalinav-10-15-3-error-chromedriver-cannot-be-opened-because-the-de) for info on how to navigate this.

To get a LOT of views quickly, run 5-9 units of this program in parallel. When you run 9 units of this program, you
are running 99 tabs for one cycle (which is about 2.5 minutes). 100 views X 99 tabs = 9,900 views in 2.5 minutes.
That's roughly 237,600 views per hour!!! Companies charge hundreds of dollars for what this program can do for FREE.
Also, not to brag, but this is one of the few working TikTok bots on GitHub.
