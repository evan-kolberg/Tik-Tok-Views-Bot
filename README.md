You will need a couple of things before running this file.

1. First, you will need to install chromedriver 
which version cooresponds to the version of chrome on your pc. For example, my chrome version is 92.0.4515.159.
You can chech your version by typing chrome://version in the search bar. Get the driver from this link here
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. 

2. Next you will need to install selenium for python. Do it using
this terminal command here: pip install selenium. 

Oh, one last thing: Make sure chromedriver is added to path if you are working on a Windows pc. If you are working 
on a Mac, chromedriver might not run since it has no trusted developer, so look here for what to do with that https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60362018/macos-catalinav-10-15-3-error-chromedriver-cannot-be-opened-because-the-de.

When all that is done, please edit lines 6 and 8 and put in the correct info. Line 6 is the location to chromedriver (it can be in your project folder) and
line 8 is your video URL.

As always, enjoy this project and try not to get banned ðŸ™‚




***This will not work forever because the company will most likely change their website. When that happends, this code will stop working. Feel free to use this as a refrence
sheet for selenium commands.
